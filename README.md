Virtual Wellness Planner
Project Overview
The Virtual Wellness Planner is a Java console application designed to help users manage their daily wellness routines by offering personalized activity suggestions based on their mood. It allows users to set fitness goals, track their progress, and receive motivation for physical, mental, and relaxation activities. The application integrates elements of fitness, mental health, and nutrition to help users achieve a balanced wellness lifestyle.

This program showcases the core principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and supports SDG 3: Good Health and Well-being, encouraging a holistic approach to health and well-being.

How OOP Principles Were Applied
1. Encapsulation
Private Fields: The program uses private fields in its classes, ensuring that the internal state of objects is protected and can only be accessed or modified through public methods (getters/setters).
Public Methods: The UserProfile class, Activity class, and others expose relevant functionality through methods like addActivityToPlan(), displayUserInfo(), and generatePlan(). This ensures a controlled interaction with object properties.
2. Inheritance
Activity Class Hierarchy: The Activity class is the base class, and specific types of activities, such as PhysicalActivity, MentalActivity, and RelaxationActivity, inherit from it. These subclasses share common properties like name, category, and duration, but each has unique behavior (e.g., motivational messages) implemented via method overriding.
UserProfile Hierarchy: The UserProfile class is abstract, and the WellnessUser class inherits from it to provide specific user functionality like generating wellness plans.
3. Polymorphism
The program demonstrates method overriding. For example, the displayActivityDetails() method in the Activity class is overridden in its subclasses (PhysicalActivity, MentalActivity, and RelaxationActivity) to include motivational messages specific to each activity type.
4. Abstraction
The abstract UserProfile class and the MoodAnalyzer interface hide the complexity of user management and mood-based activity suggestions. For example, WellnessUser implements the MoodAnalyzer interface, providing a way to analyze the userâ€™s mood and suggest activities without exposing the implementation details of how suggestions are generated.
Chosen SDG: SDG 3: Good Health and Well-being
This project directly supports Sustainable Development Goal 3 (SDG 3): Good Health and Well-being. The app promotes mental and physical well-being by encouraging users to engage in wellness activities, offering personalized plans, and helping them track progress toward their health goals. It helps users manage stress, stay physically active, and make mindful wellness choices by providing a variety of activity suggestions and nutrition tips.
